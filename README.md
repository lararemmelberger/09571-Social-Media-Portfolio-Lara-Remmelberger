My website is structured in 3 main pages: Home, my Resume and the Class Overview
The home button can be viewed as a sort of cover, considering that this is a portfolio.
My resume shows my educational path, a view skills I learned throughout this semester and also a selection of my personal Information, including a picture of myself.
The class overview can be accessed through the navigation on the top of the screen or through a direct link on my resume.
It includes structured links that lead to summaries of my social media platform study case and what we learned in our selective classes.
For the layout I chose to have a navigation bar at the top and an overall minimalistic asthetic, using muted light and dark blue to white/black shades. 
My website has a very simple but intuitive design and can hpefully be easy to use for everyone.
