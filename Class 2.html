  <h1>Class 2: Platform Architecture and Infrastructure</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <h3>1.Platform Architecture:</h3>
  <p>- high-level structure and design of a computing platform<br>
     - encompasses the arrangement and interaction of software, hardware, networks, <br>
       and other components that make up the foundation for applications and services
     - defines how different elements of the platform work together to provide functionality and support applications
    <h3>2.Infrastructure</h3>
     - the underlying foundation of a system or organization, including hardware, <br>
       software, networks, facilities, and other essential components<br>
     - IT infrastructure provides the necessary support for information processing and communication<br>
     - includes servers, storage, networks, data centers, and other resources required for the operation <br>
       of applications and services.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Client / Server architecture</h2>
    <p>It is a computing model that describes the relationship between two types of devices or programs: clients and servers.<br>
        This architecture is widely used in computer networks and distributed systems.

    <h2>Client / Server infrastructure</h2>
    <p> The client-server architecture relies on a complex infrastructure to enable <br>
        communication between clients and servers. This infrastructure includes various <br>
        components and technologies that support the functioning of the architecture.

    <h3>Related Buzzwords:</h3>
    <h4>DNS (Domain Name System)</h4>
    <p>DNS is a part of Internet Infrastructure that translates human-readable domain names into<br>
     numerical IP addresses that can be understood by computers. Because of this we can search for websites<br>
    in a webbrowser/search for the domain name(e.g.: www.google.com), instead of having to somewow look up their IP adresses.</p>
    <h4>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):></h4>
    <p>HTTP is a set of rules or protocols that enables communication between your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)<br>
     and web servers. It's the language that allows your computer to send requests and recieve asked information.<br>
     You usually send a http request when you want to acces a website through the Internet.</p>
    <h4>TLS (Transport Layer Security)</h4>
    <p>TLS is a protocol that helps secure communication over a computer network,<br>
    ensuring the privacy, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between two systems.<br>
    It encrypts Information that is being transferred in order to prevent 3rd partys from being able to steal information along the way.</p>
