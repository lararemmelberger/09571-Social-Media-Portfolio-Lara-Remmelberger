  <h1>Class 10: Data Storage and Databases</h1>
  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data storage refers to the physical or digital means of preserving and retaining data for future use. <br>
    It is the broader concept that encompasses various methods and technologies for storing data.<br>
    Data storage can include a wide range of storage technologies, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), <br>
    solid-state drives (SSDs), cloud storage, tape storage, optical storage, and more.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Databases</h2>
    <p>It is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.<br>
        It is designed to support the efficient querying and processing of data, enforcing relationships between different pieces of information.        
        </p>
    <h2>Types of database (examples)</h2>
    <h3>Relational Databases (RDBMS):</h3>
    <p> - Organize data into tables with rows and columns.<br>
        - Enforce relationships between tables.<br>
        - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.
        </p>
    <h3>NoSQL Databases:</h3>
    <p> - Designed for flexibility and scalability.<br>
        - Do not rely on a fixed schema.
        </p>
    <h3>In-Memory Databases:</h3>
    <p>Store data in the system's main memory (RAM) for faster access.    </p>
    <h3>Distributed Databases:</h3>
    <p>Distribute data across multiple nodes or servers for improved scalability and fault tolerance.</p>
    <h3>Related Buzzwords: ACID</h3>
    <p>ACID stands for:<br>
    1.Atomicity: Views the entire Data transaction as a single unit. <br>
    If theres an error with even just one element of that transaction, the entire transaction will be rolled back and the database will stay unchanged.<br>
    2. Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.<br>
    If a transaction violates any integrity constraints, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to its previous state.
    3.Isolation: Isolation ensures that the execution of one transaction is isolated from the execution of other transactions.<br>
    It prevents interference between transactions, which can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results.
    4. Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects will persist even in the event of a system failure. They are permanent.</p>
